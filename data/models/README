The models provided for CRF )Mallet), MIRA, SVM and RNN were trained on the training subsets of the following clinical text notes corpora with PII annotations:
- 2006 i2b2
- 2014 i2b2
- 2016 n2c2
- 2021 MUSC (not publicly available)
All corpora were de-identified (with manual verification) and all PII "re-synthesized" (i.e., replaced with realistic surrogates).

Training parameters for these models:
- CRF
- MIRA
- SVM
- RNN

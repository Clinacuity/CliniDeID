Goal is to have documentation for each model that includes 
	branch/commit tag from git for code
	description of what corpus was used
	date it was done (in case corpus changes)
	parameters used for training (both feature generatin and model training), depending on what options the model could have
	recall, precision and f1 scores on test set for unified I2B2 2014, 2016, and resynth MUSC

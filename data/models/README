The large model files need to be in subfolders here as following:

folder mira
mira/mira-U3-FullSplit

folder  svm
svm/svmModel-U3-FullSplit
svm/svmMap-U3-FullSplit

folder malletCrf

malletCrf/crf-U3-FullSplit.jar

The models provided for CRF (Mallet), MIRA, SVM and RNN were trained on the combined training subsets of the following clinical text notes corpora with annotated PII annotations:
- 2006 i2b2 de-identification challenge (https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-2006/)
- 2014 i2b2/UTHealth de-identification challenge (https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-2014/)
- 2016 CEGS N-GRID n2c2 de-identification challenge (not available outside the original challenge anymore; https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-2016/)
All corpora were de-identified (with manual verification) and all PII "re-synthesized" (i.e., replaced with realistic surrogates) before training.

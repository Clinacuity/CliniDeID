The models provided for CRF (Mallet), MIRA, SVM and RNN were trained on the combined training subsets of the following clinical text notes corpora with PII annotations:
- 2006 i2b2 (https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/)
- 2014 i2b2 (https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/)
- 2016 n2c2 (not available outside the original challenge anymore)
- MUSC (not publicly available; trained in 2021)
All corpora were de-identified (with manual verification) and all PII "re-synthesized" (i.e., replaced with realistic surrogates) before training.

Training parameters for these models:
- CRF
- MIRA
- SVM
- RNN

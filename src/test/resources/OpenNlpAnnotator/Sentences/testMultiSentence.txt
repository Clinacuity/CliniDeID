This is a 54-year-old black male who has had some chronic back pain on and off ever since a gunshot wound in 1954 to his pelvis. 
Apparently he had a consult some years ago sometime in 2009 with a neurosurgeon in Texas. Patient selected himself out of surgery because he was told by Dr. Shoddy on  July 07, 2010 of last year, that it was not a medical necessity since he has been living with the pain since 1954.  Mr. Leng presents today at 21:34 with intense back pain for the past 3 days that initially started on or about Sept  13, 09/14, or 9/15/2011 reporting no acute injury, or fall.  He reports weakness in his legs beginning on 09/30/2011 with no loss of motor 
control or bowel or bladder.  
Patient reports he is usually able to walk with some assistance using a cane, but now he has had to use it because of weakness in the left hip.  An MRI was done at the clinic in Texas, but when I obtain his hard copy records I do not see any  transfer of that data. Patient informs me that his primary care providers have treated his back pain as a chronic issue without intervention.  An older LS spine film was taken at this facility on 01/01/2011. This older spine film is suggestive of spondylolisthesis, but           otherwise was unremarkable.

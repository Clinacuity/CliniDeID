This is a 77-year-old right-handed previously active and independent
      white male who underwent a ventricular fibrillation arrest on 01/05/2005

              This
      was witnessed by his wife . She immediately called 911 and the patient was able
      to be defibrillated within 5 minutes . He was taken to Lakeview Hospital . Emergency Room .
              
He was found to have a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction

              The . CK was never greater than 900 . He was found on catheterization to have a 95%
      complex ulcerated mid LAD plaque, as well as less significant plaques of the RCA
      and left circumflex . He underwent stent placement . The ejection fraction was
      75% .
              
Post procedure, he did have hypotension, requiring dopamine and Neo-
      Synephrine

              He was placed on a ventilator and had an elevated white count,
      treated for presumed aspiration with Zosyn . A chest x-ray was clear 01/07/2005 .
              
He had a long history of atrial fibrillation and was in atrial fibrillation
      throughout his acute hospital stay

              He was transferred to LDS Hospital . Rehabilitation Unit for more functionary care. .
            

              
The patient on his first day of rehab was noted to have
      significant hypotension with short ambulation

              A spiral CT was done, which
      showed bilateral lower lobe pulmonary emboli . He was placed on heparin until . Coumadin was brought into therapeutic range . His pulmonary status improved in
      terms of not requiring oxygen when up and ambulating .
              
He was rather hypotensive
      in the initial part of his hospital stay

              Coreg and an ACE inhibitor were
      discontinued temporarily .
              
His blood pressure did over the next several days
      improve and he was tolerating a low dose of Lopressor by the time of transfer to
      the ICU

              He was also noted to have an elevated PSA of 29% . Given this, plus abnormal
      oximetry, SPEP was done which showed elevated M spike . A Foley catheter was
      placed in order to help with collection of urine (patient had significant
      agitation and distractibility, as well as incontinence and could not be relied
      upon for 24-hour urine collection without this).  He required one-to-one
      supervision and had significant problems sleeping . He was able to be distracted
      and participate in therapies, however, during the day . On the evening of his transfer, the patient removed the inflated Foley catheter . There was significant bleeding . The patient became extremely agitated . He
      developed respiratory distress, with respiratory rate of 80, shallow breathing . Lactic acid level was greater than 7.1 . Because of his deteriorating condition,
      he was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and intervention, including
      intubation . JOHN HOUSE, MD

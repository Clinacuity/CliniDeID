      significant hypotension with short ambulation</content>
              A spiral CT was done, which
      showed bilateral lower lobe pulmonary emboli . He was placed on heparin until . Coumadin was brought into therapeutic range . His pulmonary status improved in

      oximetry, SPEP was done which showed elevated M spike . A Foley catheter was
      placed in order to help with collection of urine (patient had significant
      agitation and distractibility, as well as incontinence and could not be relied
      upon for 24-hour urine collection without this).  He required one-to-one
      supervision and had significant problems sleeping . He was able to be distracted
      and participate in therapies, however, during the day . On the evening of his transfer, the patient removed the inflated Foley catheter . There was significant bleeding . The patient became extremely agitated . He
      developed respiratory distress, with respiratory rate of 80, shallow breathing . Lactic acid level was greater than 7.1 . Because of his deteriorating condition,
      he was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and intervention, including
      intubation . JOHN HOUSE, MD

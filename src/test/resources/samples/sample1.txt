DD: 10/01/2011@21:34   DT: 10/01/2011   251   /JOB#: 20567                        PATIENT NAME:  LENG, BILL R

-CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient reports today 10/01/2011@21:34 with c/o lower back pain for three days, with radiation into his left buttock, hip, and leg.                         

-HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old black male who has had some chronic back pain on and off ever since a gunshot wound in 1954 to his pelvis.  Apparently he had a consult some years ago sometime in 2009 with a neurosurgeon in Texas . Patient selected himself out of surgery because he was told by Dr. Shoddy on  July 07, 2010 of last year, that it was not a medical necessity since he has been living with the pain since 1954.  Mr. Leng presents today at 21:34 with intense back pain for the past 3 days that initially started on or about Sept  13, 09/14, or 9/15/2011 reporting no acute injury, or fall.  He reports weakness in his legs beginning on 09/30/2011 with no loss of motor control or bowel or bladder.  Patient reports he is usually able to walk with some assistance using a cane, but now he has had to use it because of weakness in the left hip.  An MRI was done at the clinic in Texas, but when I obtain his hard copy records I do not see any  transfer of that data. Patient informs me that his primary care providers have treated his back pain as a chronic issue without intervention.  An older LS spine film was taken at this facility on 01/01/2011. This older spine film is suggestive of spondylolisthesis, but           otherwise was unremarkable.
